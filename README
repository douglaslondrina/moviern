# Moviern

A simple React-Native example App that uses [TheMovieDB.org] API to show some new and trending movies in a modern, Netflix style UI.

## Things that we could improve:

* Control total number of pages on requests so we don't keep asking for more content in the end of the list.
* We should be able to change the city that we are querying for, but there isn't a design ready for that.
* It was used a FlatList with "fake" sections so we could have a grid style without using a more complex grid component (SectionList doesn't offer column styled layout). A good option would be https://github.com/saleel/react-native-super-grid
* Use the movie Backdrop image as the main image background in GridScreen. Some layer of opacity or a gradient should be added on top (maybe the one from the design spec).

## TODO

- [ ] Define Prop types for MovieItem and MovieScreen;
- [ ] Write Jest Tests;
- [ ] Cleanup styles and move to separated files;
- [ ] Use a image for the cover blue shadown on Android. Elevation does not support different colors in RN right now (altough it may be comming soon);
- [ ] Paddings could be respected more closely if not used globally. Carousel has its peculia;
- [ ] Use Context to pass on navigation props;
